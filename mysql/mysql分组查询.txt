select class from user group by class; 
select class,GROUP_CONCAT(name) from user group by class;分组展示姓名

select GROUP_CONCAT(name),class from user group by class;跟上边显示不一样

select class as 班级,name as 姓名,max(scores) as 最高分 from user group by class;

找出最高分再求和

select sum(maxscores) as 最高分之和 from (select max(scores) as maxscores from user group by class) as t; 一定要有as t 以及maxscores 前后要一致 ，子查询出来的结果相当于一个表，然后再查询

找出最低分
select * from user where scores=any(select min(scores) from user group by class);

select sum(scores) as 最低分之和 from user where scores=any(select min(scores) from user group by class);
